so for nathan's web project, we started by reviewing the homepage redesign. alex said the new hero image loads faster, but megan noticed the text overlay is hard to read on mobile. ryan suggested increasing the contrast and testing with different font weights. olivia shared feedback from the last user test—most users liked the new navigation bar, but a few found the dropdown menus confusing. lucas proposed adding icons to the dropdowns for clarity. there was a discussion about the blog section: megan is working on the rss feed integration, and ryan is fixing a bug where the post dates display in the wrong timezone. alex brought up the contact form spam issue; olivia suggested adding a simple captcha, and lucas volunteered to implement it. we also talked about the about page—megan wants to add a timeline of project milestones, and ryan will draft the content. before wrapping up, we reviewed action items: alex to tweak the hero text and review navigation icons, megan to finish rss and start the timeline, ryan to fix blog dates and draft about page, olivia to test the captcha, and lucas to implement it. we agreed to meet again next week and send a summary of decisions to nathan for approval.
