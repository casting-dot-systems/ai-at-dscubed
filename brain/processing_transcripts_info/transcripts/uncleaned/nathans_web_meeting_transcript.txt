Uh, hey, can you hear me? I think my mic is—wait, yeah, it’s working now. Yeah, I got you. Sorry, my dog was barking. So, um, about the homepage, did you get a chance to look at the wireframes? Yeah, I did, but, uh, I think the header is too big? Or maybe it’s just my screen. Also, the colors… I mean, do we really want that much blue? Oh, yeah, the blue. I was just using the default, but we can totally change it. Wait, hold on, my phone’s ringing—

[2 min pause]

Sorry, that was my mom. Where were we? Oh, right, colors. What if we try, like, a lighter shade? Yeah, lighter is good. Also, the blog section, I, uh, I couldn’t figure out how to get the posts to show up. The code just… it’s not working. Did you pull the latest from Git? I pushed a fix last night, I think. Or maybe it was this morning? Time is fake. Haha, yeah, I’ll check. Oh, and the about page—should we put Nathan’s photo or just a cartoon? Cartoon, for sure. Nathan hates his photos. Wait, did you see the email from him? He wants the site live by Friday. That’s, uh, soon. Oh, wow, okay. Guess we’re not sleeping this week. Anyway, I’ll fix the header and check the blog thing. You do the colors? Yup, I’ll do that after lunch. Or maybe after my nap. We’ll see. Cool, cool. Anything else? Nah, I think that’s it. Unless you wanna talk about the footer. But, like, who cares about footers? LOL, true. Alright, talk later. Later.

[10 minutes later]

Hey, back again. So, I tried to fix the header, but now the nav bar is floating in the middle of the page. No idea why. Did you change something in the CSS grid? Uh, maybe? I was messing with the container class, but I thought it only affected the sidebar. Well, it’s definitely floating. Also, the logo disappeared. Wait, what? It was there this morning. Did you rename the assets folder? Oh, shoot, yeah, I did. Sorry, I’ll fix the path. No worries. Also, do you think we should add a contact form? Nathan mentioned it in his last message. Ugh, contact forms. I guess we have to. Do you want to use a plugin or just roll our own? Let’s just use a plugin, less pain. But can we make sure it doesn’t send spam? Last time we got like 50 bot emails. I’ll add a captcha. Or maybe just a simple math question. Like, what’s 2+2? Haha, yeah, that’ll stop the bots. Or confuse the users. True.

[Someone joins the call]

Oh, hey, is that Nathan? No, false alarm, just my phone connecting to Bluetooth. Classic. Anyway, did you see the Figma update? The mobile view is all squished. Yeah, I noticed. I think the flexbox isn’t wrapping right. I’ll take a look. Also, do you want to grab coffee after this? I need caffeine. Yes, please. But let’s finish the about page first. Agreed. Oh, and can you review my PR? I left some comments on your last commit too. Cool, I’ll check. By the way, did you ever fix that weird bug with the dark mode toggle? Not yet. It keeps switching back to light mode when you refresh. I think it’s a localStorage thing. I’ll debug it after lunch. Sounds good.

[5 min silence]

Okay, I’m heading out for coffee. Ping me if you break the site. Will do. Don’t forget to push your changes! Already did. See ya. Later.
