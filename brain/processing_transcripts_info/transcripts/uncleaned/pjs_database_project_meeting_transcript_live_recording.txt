so for pj's database project, we started by reviewing the new schema proposal. alex said the normalization looks good, but megan pointed out that the foreign key constraints might cause issues during data migration. ryan suggested running a dry run migration on a test dataset before touching production. olivia shared feedback from the dev team—apparently, some legacy scripts still expect the old table names, so lucas volunteered to update the scripts after the migration. there was a discussion about indexing: megan is working on optimizing the queries for the analytics dashboard, and ryan is testing different index strategies to speed up report generation. alex brought up a bug where duplicate records appear after batch imports; olivia suggested adding a unique constraint, and lucas will implement it. we also talked about backup and restore procedures—megan wants to automate nightly backups, and ryan will test the restore process this week.

then we spent some time debating whether to use jsonb columns for flexible metadata or stick with a strict schema. megan argued that jsonb would make it easier to add new features, but alex worried about query performance and data validation. ryan suggested a hybrid approach, using jsonb only for optional fields. olivia mentioned that the security team flagged some tables for missing encryption at rest, so lucas will coordinate with devops to enable it. there was a tangent about user permissions—apparently, some analysts have more access than they should, so megan will review the current roles and update the access policy.

we also discussed the migration plan in detail: ryan will write scripts to validate data integrity before and after migration, and alex will prepare a rollback plan in case anything goes wrong. olivia brought up the need for better monitoring—she suggested setting up alerts for slow queries and failed jobs, and lucas will look into integrating with the team's slack channel. megan shared some user feedback from the analytics team, who want faster report generation and more export options. we agreed to prioritize query optimization and add csv export to the backlog.

before wrapping up, we reviewed action items: alex to finalize schema, review constraints, and draft rollback plan; megan to optimize queries, set up backups, and review user roles; ryan to test migration, restore, and write validation scripts; olivia to coordinate with dev team, test unique constraints, and set up monitoring; lucas to update legacy scripts, enable encryption, and integrate alerts. we scheduled a follow-up meeting for next thursday and agreed to send a detailed migration plan to pj for approval. finally, we joked about how many times we've rewritten this database and promised to bring snacks to the next meeting.
