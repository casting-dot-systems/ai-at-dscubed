so the etl job failed again last night erin said it was probably the s3 permissions but frank thought it might be the new schema for sales data dave said the processed data bucket was missing some files and the dashboard is still showing old numbers we talked about rolling back the schema change but decided to patch the loader first erin will do that after lunch frank mentioned the bi team is waiting for the new data feed and dave said he would ping them about the delay also there was a discussion about automating the error alerts so we dont have to check logs manually every morning someone suggested using airflow for scheduling but no one knows if we have a license for that erin asked if we could get a test environment set up for the new pipeline and frank said he would check with devops there was also a tangent about the upcoming audit and making sure all data is properly logged and versioned 
then dave brought up the issue with the timezone conversions in the sales data, apparently some records are still in utc while others are in local time, which is messing up the daily reports. frank suggested adding a normalization step in the loader, but erin was worried it would slow down the pipeline. after some debate, we agreed to run a test on a small batch first. then there was a long discussion about data retention policies, with everyone confused about how long we need to keep raw logs. dave said he would check the compliance docs. frank mentioned the new data validation scripts, but erin said they were flagging too many false positives. we decided to tweak the thresholds and review the flagged records manually for now. someone asked about the backup strategy, and frank admitted he forgot to test the last restore. we put that on the to-do list. before wrapping up, erin asked if we could get a dashboard for pipeline health metrics, and dave said he would look into grafana integration. we ended by reviewing action items: erin to patch loader and test normalization, frank to check devops and backup restore, dave to ping bi team and look into grafana, and everyone to review data retention policy before the audit. then we joked about how the pipeline never works on mondays and called it a day.
