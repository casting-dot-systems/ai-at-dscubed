so um the new color palette is mostly done but henry thinks the green is too bright irene said we need to run accessibility tests before launch grace mentioned the onboarding flow is still too long and users are dropping off before finishing the tutorial henry will try shortening the tutorial and irene will run the accessibility tests grace will get feedback from marketing about the new design there was a discussion about adding a dark mode option but no one is sure if we have time in this sprint also someone brought up the app store reviews and how users want faster load times irene suggested optimizing the image assets and henry said he could look into lazy loading grace reminded everyone to update the changelog before release and there was a quick chat about the new push notification system which is still in beta 
then henry brought up the navigation bar, saying some users find it confusing because the icons aren't labeled. irene suggested adding tooltips, but grace worried it would clutter the interface. after some back and forth, we agreed to test both options with a small user group. there was a tangent about whether to use rounded or square buttons, with everyone having a different opinion. eventually, we decided to let the designer make the call. irene mentioned a bug where the app crashes if you open settings too quickly after launch, and henry said he would try to reproduce it. grace brought up the need for better analytics to track user engagement, so we put that on the backlog. before wrapping up, we reviewed action items: henry to shorten tutorial and check crash bug, irene to run accessibility tests and help with analytics, grace to get marketing feedback and update changelog, and everyone to review the new push system. then we all agreed to meet again after the next sprint review and joked about how many versions of the app we've released this year.
