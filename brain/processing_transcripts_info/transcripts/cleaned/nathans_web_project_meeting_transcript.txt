Alex: For Nathan's web project, we started by reviewing the homepage redesign. The new hero image loads faster.

Megan: I noticed the text overlay is hard to read on mobile.

Ryan: We should increase the contrast and test with different font weights.

Olivia: I have feedback from the last user test. Most users liked the new navigation bar, but a few found the dropdown menus confusing.

Lucas: Maybe we could add icons to the dropdowns for clarity.

Megan: Regarding the blog section, I’m working on the RSS feed integration.

Ryan: I’m fixing a bug where the post dates display in the wrong timezone.

Alex: There’s also a contact form spam issue.

Olivia: We could add a simple captcha.

Lucas: I can implement that.

Megan: For the About page, I want to add a timeline of project milestones.

Ryan: I’ll draft the content for that.

Alex: Before we wrap up, let’s review action items. I’ll tweak the hero text and review navigation icons.

Megan: I’ll finish the RSS feed and start the timeline for the About page.

Ryan: I’ll fix the blog post dates and draft the About page content.

Olivia: I’ll test the captcha once it’s implemented.

Lucas: I’ll implement the captcha.

Alex: We’ll meet again next week and send a summary of our decisions to Nathan for approval.
