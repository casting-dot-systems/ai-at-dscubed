Alex: Hey, can you hear me? I think my mic is—wait, yeah, it’s working now.

Jamie: Yeah, I got you. Sorry, my dog was barking.

Alex: So, about the homepage, did you get a chance to look at the wireframes?

Jamie: Yeah, I did, but I think the header is too big. Or maybe it’s just my screen. Also, the colors… Do we really want that much blue?

Alex: Oh, yeah, the blue. I was just using the default, but we can totally change it. Wait, hold on, my phone’s ringing—

[2 minute pause]

Alex: Sorry, that was my mom. Where were we?

Jamie: Oh, right, colors. What if we try a lighter shade?

Alex: Yeah, lighter is good. Also, the blog section—I couldn’t figure out how to get the posts to show up. The code just isn’t working.

Jamie: Did you pull the latest from Git? I pushed a fix last night, I think. Or maybe it was this morning? Time is fake.

Alex: Haha, yeah. I’ll check. Oh, and the about page—should we put Nathan’s photo or just a cartoon?

Jamie: Cartoon, for sure. Nathan hates his photos. Wait, did you see the email from him? He wants the site live by Friday.

Alex: That’s soon.

Jamie: Oh, wow, okay. Guess we’re not sleeping this week. Anyway, I’ll fix the header and check the blog thing. You do the colors?

Alex: Yup, I’ll do that after lunch. Or maybe after my nap. We’ll see.

Jamie: Cool, cool. Anything else?

Alex: Nah, I think that’s it. Unless you want to talk about the footer. But, like, who cares about footers?

Jamie: True. Alright, talk later.

Alex: Later.

[10 minutes later]

Alex: Hey, back again. So, I tried to fix the header, but now the nav bar is floating in the middle of the page. No idea why. Did you change something in the CSS grid?

Jamie: Uh, maybe? I was messing with the container class, but I thought it only affected the sidebar.

Alex: Well, it’s definitely floating. Also, the logo disappeared.

Jamie: Wait, what? It was there this morning. Did you rename the assets folder?

Alex: Oh, shoot, yeah, I did. Sorry, I’ll fix the path.

Jamie: No worries. Also, do you think we should add a contact form? Nathan mentioned it in his last message.

Alex: Ugh, contact forms. I guess we have to. Do you want to use a plugin or just roll our own?

Jamie: Let’s just use a plugin—less pain. But can we make sure it doesn’t send spam? Last time we got like 50 bot emails.

Alex: I’ll add a captcha. Or maybe just a simple math question. Like, what’s 2+2?

Jamie: Haha, yeah, that’ll stop the bots. Or confuse the users.

Alex: True.

[Someone joins the call]

Jamie: Oh, hey, is that Nathan?

Alex: No, false alarm, just my phone connecting to Bluetooth.

Jamie: Classic. Anyway, did you see the Figma update? The mobile view is all squished.

Alex: Yeah, I noticed. I think the flexbox isn’t wrapping right. I’ll take a look. Also, do you want to grab coffee after this? I need caffeine.

Jamie: Yes, please. But let’s finish the about page first.

Alex: Agreed. Oh, and can you review my PR? I left some comments on your last commit too.

Jamie: Cool, I’ll check. By the way, did you ever fix that weird bug with the dark mode toggle?

Alex: Not yet. It keeps switching back to light mode when you refresh. I think it’s a localStorage thing. I’ll debug it after lunch.

Jamie: Sounds good.

[5 minute silence]

Alex: Okay, I’m heading out for coffee. Ping me if you break the site.

Jamie: Will do. Don’t forget to push your changes!

Alex: Already did. See ya.

Jamie: Later.
