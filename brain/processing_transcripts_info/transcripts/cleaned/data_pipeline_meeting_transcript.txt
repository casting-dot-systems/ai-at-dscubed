Erin: The ETL job failed again last night.

Frank: I think it might be the new schema for the sales data.

Erin: It was probably the S3 permissions.

Dave: The processed data bucket was missing some files, and the dashboard is still showing old numbers.

Frank: Should we roll back the schema change?

Erin: Let's patch the loader first. I'll do that after lunch.

Frank: The BI team is waiting for the new data feed.

Dave: I'll ping them about the delay.

[pause]

Dave: We should automate the error alerts so we don't have to check logs manually every morning.

Frank: Maybe we could use Airflow for scheduling?

Erin: Do we even have a license for Airflow?

Frank: Not sure.

Erin: Can we get a test environment set up for the new pipeline?

Frank: I'll check with DevOps.

[pause]

Frank: By the way, there's the upcoming audit. We need to make sure all data is properly logged and versioned.

Dave: Also, there's an issue with timezone conversions in the sales data. Some records are still in UTC while others are in local time, which is messing up the daily reports.

Frank: We could add a normalization step in the loader.

Erin: I'm worried that would slow down the pipeline.

[interruption]

Frank: Let's run a test on a small batch first.

[pause]

Dave: We need to talk about data retention policies. How long do we need to keep raw logs?

Frank: I'm not sure.

Dave: I'll check the compliance docs.

Frank: The new data validation scripts are in place.

Erin: They're flagging too many false positives.

Frank: Let's tweak the thresholds and review the flagged records manually for now.

[pause]

Person 1: What about our backup strategy?

Frank: I forgot to test the last restore. I'll add that to my to-do list.

[pause]

Erin: Can we get a dashboard for pipeline health metrics?

Dave: I'll look into Grafana integration.

[pause]

Erin: Let's review action items. I'll patch the loader and test the normalization step.

Frank: I'll check with DevOps about the test environment and test the backup restore.

Dave: I'll ping the BI team and look into Grafana integration.

Erin: Everyone should review the data retention policy before the audit.

[pause]

Frank: The pipeline never works on Mondays.

[everyone laughs]

[Meeting ends.]
