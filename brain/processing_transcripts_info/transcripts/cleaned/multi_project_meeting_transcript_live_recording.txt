Liam: So for today's meeting, we have updates on three projects: Even's Marathon, Nathan's Web, and PJ's Database. Let's start with Even's Marathon—the city permit application is still pending but should be approved by next week. I've also been working on sponsorship outreach; three local businesses have agreed to provide water stations.

Maya: That's great, but we still need a main sponsor for the finish line.

Alex: Speaking of sponsors, I have an update on Nathan's Web project—the payment gateway integration is almost done. But Megan noticed the text overlay on the homepage is hard to read on mobile.

Megan: Yeah, we need to increase the contrast and test with different font weights.

Liam: Back to Even's Marathon—Sophie brought up volunteer recruitment. We have 25 signed up but need at least 40.

Maya: I suggested reaching out to the university's running club for more volunteers.

Alex: And for Nathan's Web, I'm fixing a bug where the post dates display in the wrong timezone. Also, the contact form is getting spam, so I suggested adding a simple captcha.

Megan: For PJ's Database, I'm working on optimizing the queries for the analytics dashboard. I also found a bug where duplicate records appear after batch imports.

Alex: I'll implement a unique constraint for that.

Liam: For Even's Marathon, the 10k loop is finalized, but the 5k needs a detour because of roadworks.

Maya: I'll check with the city about alternate routes.

Alex: For Nathan's Web, most users liked the new navigation bar, but a few found the dropdown menus confusing.

Lucas: I proposed adding icons to the dropdowns for clarity.

Megan: For PJ's Database, I'm testing different index strategies to speed up report generation. I'll also coordinate with DevOps to enable encryption at rest.

Liam: There was a brief debate about t-shirt colors for Even's Marathon—Maya prefers blue, Lucas votes for green.

Alex: We decided to send a poll to all registered runners.

Megan: For Nathan's Web, I want to add a timeline of project milestones to the About page.

Alex: I'll draft the content for that.

Megan: For PJ's Database, some analysts have more access than they should, so I'll review the current roles. I also want to automate nightly backups.

Alex: I'll test the restore process this week.

Liam: For Even's Marathon, Olivia mentioned the need for a medical tent and first aid volunteers.

Sophie: I'll contact the local clinic.

Alex: For Nathan's Web, I'm working on the RSS feed integration.

Megan: And for PJ's Database, I'll write scripts to validate data integrity before and after migration. I'll prepare a rollback plan in case anything goes wrong.

Alex: We also need better monitoring for PJ's Database—I suggest setting up alerts for slow queries. I'll look into integrating with the team's Slack channel.

Liam: For Even's Marathon, we need to test the mobile version of the registration website.

Alex: And for Nathan's Web, we should prioritize query optimization and add CSV export to the backlog.

Liam: So let's review action items:
- For Even's Marathon: Maya to follow up on permits and route, Liam to finish payment integration.
- For Nathan's Web: Alex to tweak the hero text and review navigation icons, Megan to finish RSS and start the timeline.
- For PJ's Database: Alex to finalize schema and review constraints, Megan to optimize queries and set up backups.

Maya: And we scheduled follow-up meetings for all three projects next week.

Alex: Finally, we joked about how many times we've rewritten PJ's Database and promised to bring snacks to the next meeting.
