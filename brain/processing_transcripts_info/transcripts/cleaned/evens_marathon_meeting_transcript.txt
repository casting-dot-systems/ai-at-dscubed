Maya: Let's start by reviewing the event timeline. The marathon date is set for September 15th.

Liam: The city permit application is still pending, but it should be approved by next week.

Liam: For sponsorship outreach, three local businesses have agreed to provide water stations and snacks. However, we still need a main sponsor for the finish line.

Sophie: Regarding volunteer recruitment, we have 25 people signed up, but we need at least 40 for race day.

Olivia: Maybe we can reach out to the university's running club to find more volunteers.

Lucas: On route planning, the 10k loop is finalized, but the 5k needs a detour because of roadworks on Main Street.

Maya: I'll check with the city about alternate routes.

Liam: For the registration website, the payment gateway integration is almost done.

Sophie: Let's make sure to test the mobile version as well.

Maya: About t-shirt colors, I prefer blue.

Lucas: I vote for green.

Sophie: Let's send a poll to all registered runners to decide.

Olivia: We also need a medical tent and first aid volunteers.

Sophie: I'll contact the local clinic about that.

Maya: Before we wrap up, let's review action items. I'll follow up on permits and the route.

Liam: I'll finish the payment integration and draft sponsor emails.

Sophie: I'll recruit more volunteers and contact the clinic.

Olivia: I'll coordinate with the running club.

Lucas: I'll update the route map.
