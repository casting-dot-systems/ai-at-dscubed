Maya: Let's start by reviewing the event timeline. The marathon date is set for September 15th.

Liam: The city permit application is still pending, but it should be approved by next week.

Liam: For sponsorship outreach, three local businesses have agreed to provide water stations and snacks. However, we still need a main sponsor for the finish line.

Sophie: Regarding volunteer recruitment, we have 25 people signed up, but we need at least 40 for race day.

Olivia: Maybe we can reach out to the university's running club to find more volunteers.

Lucas: On route planning, the 10k loop is finalized. However, the 5k route needs a detour because of roadworks on Main Street.

Maya: I'll check with the city about alternate routes for the 5k.

Liam: The registration website is almost ready. The payment gateway integration is nearly done.

Sophie: Let's make sure to test the mobile version of the registration site as well.

Maya: About the t-shirt colors, I prefer blue.

Lucas: I vote for green.

Sophie: How about we send a poll to all registered runners to decide?

Olivia: We also need a medical tent and first aid volunteers.

Sophie: I'll contact the local clinic to arrange that.

[pause]

Maya: Let's review action items before we wrap up. I'll follow up on the permits and the route.

Liam: I'll finish the payment integration and draft sponsor emails.

Sophie: I'll recruit more volunteers and contact the clinic.

Olivia: I'll coordinate with the running club.

Lucas: I'll update the route map.

Maya: Our next meeting is scheduled for two weeks from today. Let's also send out a project update email to all stakeholders by Friday.

All: Agreed.
