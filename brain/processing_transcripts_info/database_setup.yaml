# Database Setup Configuration for Processing Transcripts
# This YAML file defines the sequential order for running DDL files

  name: "Processing Transcripts Database"
  description: "Setup script for committee, meeting, and project management tables"
  
  # Step 1: Create base entity tables (no dependencies)
  - step: 1
    name: "Create Base Tables"
    description: "Create the main entity tables that other tables will reference"
    files:
      - "DDL/committee.sql"
      - "DDL/meeting.sql"
      - "DDL/project.sql"
    dependencies: []
    
  # Step 2: Create linking tables (depend on base tables)
  - step: 2
    name: "Create Linking Tables"
    description: "Create junction tables that link entities together"
    files:

# Execution notes:
# - Each step must complete successfully before moving to the next
# - If any file in a step fails, the entire step is rolled back
# - Foreign key constraints ensure referential integrity
