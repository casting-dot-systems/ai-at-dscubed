Aaron: Welcome to our workshop on the Committee Management System and Winter Cohort Onboarding projects. These are two critical systems that will help us scale our operations.

Andy S: Let's start with the Committee Management System. We need a comprehensive solution for managing member roles, communications, and project assignments.

Michelle: The current system is getting unwieldy. We're using spreadsheets and Discord roles, but it's not scalable as we grow.

Chi: I think we need a centralized database that tracks member skills, availability, and project preferences.

Dharani: What about role management? We need to clearly define committee roles and responsibilities.

Pia: We should create a role hierarchy system. Some members might have multiple roles across different projects.

Sarah A: For the winter cohort onboarding, we need to automate the process. Currently, it's very manual and time-consuming.

Andy L: We could create an onboarding portal where new members complete forms, watch orientation videos, and get assigned mentors.

Karen: What about the committee management system interface? Should it be web-based or integrated into Discord?

Matthew: I think it should be web-based for the admin functions, but with Discord integration for notifications and updates.

Fairy: For the winter cohort, we need to think about the timeline. When do we start the onboarding process?

Natty: We should start 2 weeks before the cohort begins. That gives us time to process applications and assign mentors.

Trinity: What about the committee management system features? We need member profiles, skill tracking, and project assignment tools.

Shayomi: We should also have reporting features. How do we track member engagement and project participation?

Aaron: Good point. We need analytics to understand how our committee is performing and where we need improvements.

Michelle: For the winter cohort onboarding, what's the application process? Should we use Google Forms or build a custom application system?

Chi: I think we should build a custom system. It would integrate better with our committee management database.

Dharani: What about the mentor assignment process? How do we match new members with experienced committee members?

Pia: We could create a matching algorithm based on skills, interests, and availability. The system could suggest optimal mentor-mentee pairs.

Sarah A: For the committee management system, we need to think about permissions. Not everyone should have access to all member data.

Andy L: We should implement role-based access control. Committee leads get more access than regular members.

Karen: What about the winter cohort onboarding timeline? How long should the onboarding process take?

Matthew: I think 2 weeks is reasonable. Week 1 for orientation and paperwork, week 2 for project assignments and mentor meetings.

Fairy: For the committee management system, we need to integrate with our existing tools. How does it connect with Discord, Notion, and our project tracking?

Natty: We should create APIs that sync data between all our systems. Real-time updates would be ideal.

Trinity: What about the winter cohort application review process? Who reviews applications and how do we make decisions?

Shayomi: We could create a review committee with specific criteria. The system could help track applications and decisions.

Aaron: For the committee management system, what's our development timeline? This is a complex system.

Michelle: I estimate 4-5 months for the full system. We could break it into phases: member profiles first, then role management, then analytics.

Chi: For the winter cohort onboarding, we need to create orientation materials. Who will develop the training content?

Dharani: I can help create the orientation videos and documentation. We should cover our mission, projects, and communication protocols.

Pia: What about the committee management system database design? We need to plan for scalability and data integrity.

Sarah A: We should use PostgreSQL with proper foreign key constraints and data validation rules.

Andy L: For the winter cohort, we need to think about the application form. What information should we collect?

Karen: Basic info, skills, interests, availability, and why they want to join AI@DSCubed. We should also ask about their AI experience level.

Matthew: For the committee management system, we need to plan for data migration. How do we move from our current spreadsheets?

Fairy: We should create a migration script that validates data and handles any inconsistencies.

Natty: What about the winter cohort mentor training? How do we prepare mentors for their role?

Trinity: We should create a mentor training program. Mentors need to understand their responsibilities and how to support new members.

Shayomi: For the committee management system, we need to think about notifications. How do we keep members informed about updates?

Aaron: Email notifications for important updates, Discord notifications for urgent matters, and in-app notifications for routine updates.

Michelle: For the winter cohort, we need to plan the welcome event. How do we introduce new members to the team?

Chi: We could have a virtual welcome event with icebreakers, project presentations, and mentor introductions.

Dharani: What about the committee management system reporting? What metrics should we track?

Pia: Member engagement, project participation, skill development, and overall committee health metrics.

Sarah A: For the winter cohort, we need to think about the evaluation process. How do we assess if onboarding was successful?

Andy L: We could track completion rates, mentor feedback, and member satisfaction surveys.

Karen: What about the committee management system security? How do we protect member data?

Matthew: We should implement encryption, regular backups, and access logging. GDPR compliance is also important.

Fairy: For the winter cohort, we need to plan for different time zones. Our members are spread across different regions.

Natty: We should schedule events at different times and record sessions for members who can't attend live.

Trinity: What about the committee management system integration with our project tracking tools?

Shayomi: We should create APIs that allow project managers to assign tasks and track progress through the committee system.

Aaron: For the winter cohort, we need to think about the alumni network. How do we maintain relationships with past members?

Michelle: We could create an alumni portal and regular networking events. Past members can mentor current ones.

Chi: What about the committee management system mobile app? Should we develop one or focus on the web interface?

Dharani: I think we should start with a responsive web interface, then consider a mobile app if there's demand.

Pia: For the winter cohort, we need to plan the project assignment process. How do we match new members with projects?

Sarah A: We could create a preference matching system where new members rank their project interests.

Andy L: What about the committee management system backup and recovery? How do we handle data loss scenarios?

Karen: We should implement automated backups, disaster recovery procedures, and regular testing.

Matthew: For the winter cohort, we need to think about the feedback loop. How do we improve the onboarding process?

Fairy: We should collect feedback at multiple points: after orientation, after mentor meetings, and after the first month.

Natty: What about the committee management system user interface? Should we use a modern framework like React?

Trinity: React would be good for the frontend. We could also use a UI library like Material-UI or Ant Design.

Shayomi: For the winter cohort, we need to plan the graduation process. How do we transition members from onboarding to full participation?

Aaron: We should have a graduation ceremony and clear transition guidelines. New members should feel confident about their role.

Michelle: For the committee management system, we need to plan the rollout. Should we launch all features at once or phase them in?

Chi: I think we should phase the rollout. Start with member profiles, then add role management, then analytics.

Dharani: What about the winter cohort application deadline? When should we close applications?

Pia: We should close applications 3 weeks before the cohort starts. That gives us time to review and make decisions.

Sarah A: For the committee management system, we need to budget for development, hosting, and ongoing maintenance.

Andy L: I estimate $25,000 for development, $5,000 for hosting and maintenance annually.

Karen: For the winter cohort, we need to plan the mentor compensation or recognition system.

Matthew: We could offer leadership credits, special project opportunities, or recognition at events.

Fairy: What about the committee management system training? How do we train committee leads to use the new system?

Natty: We should create training videos, documentation, and hands-on workshops for different user roles.

Trinity: For the winter cohort, we need to think about the application review criteria. What makes a strong candidate?

Shayomi: We should look for AI interest, teamwork skills, availability, and alignment with our mission.

Aaron: Great discussion everyone. Let's summarize our action items and assign project leads.

Michelle: I'll lead the Committee Management System project and coordinate the development team.

Chi: I'll handle the user interface design and user experience for both systems.
