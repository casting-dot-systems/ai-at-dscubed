Aaron: Welcome everyone to our project planning workshop. Today we're going to discuss two major initiatives: the AI@DSCubed website redesign and Discord bot enhancements.

Andy S: Let's start with the website redesign. I've been looking at our current site and it definitely needs a modern update. The user experience could be much better.

Michelle: I agree. The current site doesn't reflect our growth as an organization. We need better project showcases and member profiles.

Chi: For the UI/UX redesign, I suggest we focus on mobile-first design. Most of our members access the site on their phones.

Dharani: What about the content management system? Should we build it from scratch or use something like WordPress?

Pia: I think we should build a custom CMS. It would give us more flexibility and better integration with our other systems.

Sarah A: That's going to increase the development time and budget. Do we have the resources for that?

Andy L: We could use a headless CMS like Strapi. It gives us the flexibility we need without building everything from scratch.

Karen: Good idea. Now for the Discord bot enhancements - what new features are we thinking about?

Matthew: I'd like to add meeting scheduling functionality. It would be great to have the bot automatically create calendar events.

Fairy: What about project tracking? We could have the bot update project status and send reminders.

Natty: We should also add role management features. The bot could help assign and track committee roles.

Trinity: For the website, what's our timeline? I think we should aim for a launch before the winter cohort starts.

Shayomi: I can help with the project management side. We'll need to coordinate between the website and bot development teams.

Aaron: Good point. Let's set some milestones. Website redesign should be done in 3 months, Discord bot enhancements in 2 months.

Michelle: For the website, we need to decide on the tech stack. I'm thinking React for the frontend, Node.js backend.

Chi: What about the design system? Should we create a custom one or use an existing framework like Material-UI?

Dharani: I think we should create our own design system. It would better represent our brand identity.

Pia: For the Discord bot, we'll need to integrate with our existing database. How do we handle user authentication?

Sarah A: We could use Discord's OAuth system and link it to our committee database.

Andy L: What about the meeting analytics? Should that be part of the bot or a separate dashboard project?

Karen: I think it should be separate. The analytics dashboard deserves its own dedicated interface.

Matthew: For the website, what content sections do we need? Project showcases, member profiles, event calendar?

Fairy: We should also have a blog section for sharing AI insights and project updates.

Natty: What about the committee management system? Should that be integrated into the website or stay separate?

Trinity: I think it should be integrated. Having everything in one place would be much better for user experience.

Shayomi: For the Discord bot, we need to think about permissions. Not everyone should be able to schedule meetings.

Aaron: Good point. Let's create role-based permissions for the bot features.

Michelle: For the website redesign, what's our budget? We'll need design work, development, and content migration.

Chi: I estimate $15,000 for the website redesign and $8,000 for the Discord bot enhancements.

Dharani: That seems reasonable. We should also budget for ongoing maintenance and updates.

Pia: For the bot, we need to decide on the hosting platform. Should we use AWS or something else?

Sarah A: AWS would be good for scalability, but we could also use Railway or Render for simpler deployment.

Andy L: What about the winter cohort onboarding? Should we integrate that into the website or keep it separate?

Karen: I think it should be integrated. New members could complete onboarding through the website.

Matthew: For the website, we need to think about SEO and accessibility. These are crucial for our public image.

Fairy: Absolutely. We should also make sure the site loads quickly and works well on all devices.

Natty: What about the meeting analytics dashboard? Should we start planning that now or focus on the website and bot first?

Trinity: I think we should focus on the website and bot first, then tackle the analytics dashboard.

Shayomi: For the bot, we need to plan the development phases. What features should we prioritize?

Aaron: Let's prioritize meeting scheduling and basic project tracking for the first phase.

Michelle: For the website, we should start with wireframes and user research. Who wants to lead the design phase?

Chi: I can help with the user research and wireframing. We should interview current members about their needs.

Dharani: For the bot, we need to decide on the programming language. Python would be consistent with our other tools.

Pia: Python with discord.py would be perfect. It's well-documented and has good community support.

Sarah A: What about the database schema changes? We'll need to add tables for meetings and project tracking.

Andy L: I can help design the database schema. We'll need to consider how it integrates with our existing committee data.

Karen: For the website, we should also plan for future scalability. What if we add more projects or members?

Matthew: Good point. We should design the architecture to handle growth without major refactoring.

Fairy: What about the winter cohort onboarding system? Should we start planning that integration now?

Natty: I think we should focus on the core website and bot features first, then add the onboarding system.

Trinity: For the bot, we need to think about error handling and logging. What happens if something goes wrong?

Shayomi: We should implement comprehensive logging and monitoring. Maybe integrate with our existing logging system.

Aaron: Great discussion everyone. Let's summarize our action items and assign responsibilities.

Michelle: I'll take the lead on the website redesign project management.

Chi: I'll handle the UI/UX design and user research for the website.

Dharani: I'll work on the database schema design and integration planning.

Pia: I'll lead the Discord bot development and feature planning.

Sarah A: I'll coordinate the budget and resource allocation for both projects.

Andy L: I'll help with the technical architecture and hosting decisions.

Karen: I'll work on the content strategy and migration planning for the website.

Matthew: I'll handle the meeting scheduling feature development for the bot.

Fairy: I'll work on the project tracking features and user interface.

Natty: I'll coordinate the integration between the website and bot systems.

Trinity: I'll handle the testing and quality assurance for both projects.

Shayomi: I'll manage the deployment and monitoring setup for both systems.

Aaron: Perfect. Let's schedule follow-up meetings for each project team. Thanks everyone for the productive discussion.
