Andy S: Welcome everyone to our AI@DSCubed project overview lecture. Today I want to give you a comprehensive update on our major initiatives and how they all work together to support our mission.

Let me start with the AI@DSCubed Website Redesign project. This is our flagship initiative to modernize our online presence and better showcase our work. The current website was built several years ago and doesn't reflect our growth as an organization. We need a modern, responsive design that highlights our projects, member profiles, and AI insights. The new site will feature a custom content management system built with React and Node.js, allowing us to easily update content and showcase our latest work. We're planning to integrate it with our Discord bot and committee management system for seamless user experience.

Next, let's talk about the Discord Bot Enhancement project. Our current bot handles basic moderation and welcome messages, but we need much more functionality. The enhanced bot will include meeting scheduling capabilities, automatic calendar event creation, and project tracking features. It will integrate with our committee management system to assign roles and track member participation. We're also planning to add analytics features that will feed into our Meeting Analytics Dashboard. The bot will be built using Python with discord.py, and we'll implement role-based permissions to ensure only authorized members can access certain features.

The Committee Management System is perhaps our most critical project. As we've grown, managing member roles, communications, and project assignments has become increasingly complex. This system will provide a centralized database for tracking member skills, availability, and project preferences. It will include role management features, automated onboarding workflows, and integration with our Discord bot and website. The system will use PostgreSQL for data storage and include comprehensive reporting features to help committee leads manage their teams effectively.

For the Winter Cohort Onboarding project, we're creating an automated system to streamline the process of bringing new members into our organization. Currently, onboarding is very manual and time-consuming. The new system will include an application portal, automated mentor assignment based on skills and interests, and a structured 2-week onboarding program. It will integrate with our committee management system and include orientation materials, project assignments, and progress tracking. We're planning to start the application process 3 weeks before each cohort begins.

Finally, let's discuss the Meeting Analytics Dashboard. This comprehensive system will track meeting participation, project progress, and committee engagement across all our platforms. It will integrate data from Discord, Google Meet, Notion, and our project tracking tools to provide actionable insights. The dashboard will include role-based views for different user types, with committee leads getting different insights than regular members. We'll track metrics like meeting attendance, participation quality, project completion rates, and overall engagement. The system will use modern analytics tools and include data visualization features to make the insights easy to understand and act upon.

All these projects are interconnected and designed to work together. The website will showcase our work and provide access to our systems. The Discord bot will handle day-to-day communications and project tracking. The committee management system will be the backbone for member data and role management. The winter cohort onboarding will streamline our growth process. And the analytics dashboard will help us understand and improve our performance across all areas.

The estimated total budget for all projects is around $60,000, with development timelines ranging from 2 to 5 months depending on the project. We're planning to phase the rollout, starting with the most critical systems first. The committee management system and Discord bot enhancements will be our top priorities, followed by the website redesign, winter cohort onboarding, and finally the analytics dashboard.

We've assigned project leads for each initiative and created cross-functional teams to ensure good coordination between projects. Regular check-ins and progress updates will help us stay on track and identify any integration challenges early. The success of these projects will significantly improve our ability to scale, manage our growing committee, and provide better value to our members and the broader AI community.

I'm excited about the potential impact of these projects. They represent a major step forward in our organization's capabilities and will help us better serve our mission of advancing AI education and research. I look forward to working with all of you on these initiatives and seeing the positive changes they bring to AI@DSCubed.
