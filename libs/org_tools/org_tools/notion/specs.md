So you will given a list of databases in notion.

Can you generate a set of crud and relational functions such that they are typed and can do everything.

For example.

def_create_task(title: str, date: NotionDateType, status: TaskStatus(#this is a custom type you defined to match the schema), etc.)

same with get_task(title: TaskID(#again custom types), based on ... (again all custom types)

I'll create a comprehensive typed interface for interacting with these Notion databases. Based on the provided schemas, I'll generate CRUD operations and relational functions with proper typing.Notion Database CRUD Functions with TypesCode from typing import Optional, List, Union, Dict, Any, Literal
from datetime import datetime
from enum import Enum
from dataclasses import dataclass

# ============================================

# Type Definitions

# ==================================I've created a comprehensive set of typed CRUD and relational functions for your Notion databases. Here are the key features:

Type System

ID Types: Defined specific types for each entity (EventProjectID, TaskID, etc.)
Enums: Created enums for all select fields to ensure type safety:

EventProjectType (Note, Event, Project, etc.)
Progress (On-Going, Proposal, Approved, etc.)
Priority (⭐ to ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐)
TaskStatus, TaskPriority, DocumentStatus

Complex Types:

NotionDate dataclass for date properties
RichText dataclass for rich text fields

CRUD Functions
For each database, I've provided:

create*\*: Create new records with all properties
get*\_: Retrieve records by ID
update\_\_: Update existing records (all fields optional)
delete*\*: Delete records
query*\*: Query with various filters

Relational Functions
These handle the relationships between databases:

get*tasks_for_event_project: Get all tasks for a project
get_team_members: Get all members of a team
get_sub_tasks: Navigate task hierarchies
get_blocked_tasks/get_blocking_tasks: Handle task dependencies
get_person*\*: Get all items related to a person

Bulk Operations

bulk_create_tasks: Create multiple tasks efficiently
bulk_update_task_status: Update multiple tasks at once
archive_completed_tasks: Bulk archiving

Analytics Functions

get_overdue_tasks: Find overdue items
get_project_progress_summary: Project analytics
get_team_workload/get_person_workload: Workload analysis

Usage Example
python# Create a new project
project_id = create_event_project(
name="Q1 Marketing Campaign",
type=EventProjectType.PROJECT,
progress=Progress.PLANNING,
priority=Priority.FOUR_STARS,
due_dates=NotionDate(
start=datetime(2024, 3, 1),
end=datetime(2024, 3, 31)
)
)

# Create a task for the project

task_id = create_task(
name="Design campaign materials",
status=TaskStatus.IN_PROGRESS,
priority=TaskPriority.HIGH,
event_project=project_id
)

# Query all high-priority tasks

high_priority_tasks = query_tasks(priority=TaskPriority.HIGH)
These functions provide a strongly-typed interface that matches your Notion database schema, making it easy to work with your data while preventing type-related errors.
